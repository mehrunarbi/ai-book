# Data Model for the AI-Native Robotics Book

This document defines the core data entities for the book content and its structure. As the project is built around Docusaurus and Markdown files, this data model is conceptual and describes the file-based entities.

## 1. Book

The top-level entity representing the entire Docusaurus website.

- **Description**: The collection of all modules, chapters, and documentation.
- **Attributes**:
  - `title`: The title of the book (e.g., "AI-Native Robotics").
  - `baseUrl`: The base URL for the deployed site.
- **Implementation**: `docusaurus.config.js`

## 2. Module

A logical grouping of related chapters, representing a major topic in the book.

- **Description**: A self-contained section of the book, like "Vision-Language-Action" or "Digital Twin Simulation".
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., `4-vla-module`).
  - `title`: The human-readable title of the module (e.g., "Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)").
  - `slug`: The URL-friendly version of the title (e.g., `/vla-module`).
- **Implementation**: A subdirectory within `docusaurus/docs/`. For example, `docusaurus/docs/vla-module/`. The module's landing page can be `index.md` within that directory.

## 3. Chapter

A single content page within a Module.

- **Description**: Represents a single topic or lesson. This is the primary unit of content.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: A unique identifier within the module (e.g., `cognitive-planning-with-llms`).
  - `title`: The title of the chapter.
  - `slug`: The URL for the chapter page.
  - `content`: The body of the chapter in Markdown (MDX) format.
  - `source_file`: The path to the original markdown file where the content is authored.
- **Implementation**: A Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) within a Module's subdirectory. For example, `docusaurus/docs/vla-module/cognitive-planning.md`.

## 4. Specification (meta-entity)

A formal document that defines the goals, requirements, and user stories for a Module.

- **Description**: The `spec.md` file generated by the `/sp.specify` command. It serves as the source of truth for what a module's content should cover.
- **Implementation**: Located at `specs/<module-id>/spec.md`.

## Relationships

- A `Book` has many `Modules`.
- A `Module` has many `Chapters`.
- A `Module` is defined by one `Specification`.

## State Transitions

The content lifecycle follows a spec-driven workflow:

1.  **Specified**: A new `Specification` is created for a `Module`.
2.  **Drafting**: The `Chapter` markdown files are being written based on the `Specification`.
3.  **Integrated**: The `Chapter` files are copied into the `docusaurus/docs` directory and included in the site's sidebar.
4.  **Published**: The Docusaurus site is built and deployed, making the `Chapter` publicly accessible.
