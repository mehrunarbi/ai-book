# Content Structure Contract

This project is a static website generated by Docusaurus and does not have a runtime API that would be defined by an OpenAPI or GraphQL schema.

The "contract" for this project is therefore the file system structure that the Docusaurus build process expects. Adherence to this structure is mandatory for the site to build correctly.

## Main `docs` Directory

- **Location**: `docusaurus/docs/`
- **Purpose**: This directory contains all the Markdown files that will be turned into pages in the book.

### Contract Rules:

1.  **Module as a Folder**: Each book module MUST be represented as a subdirectory within `docusaurus/docs/`.
    -   Example: The "VLA Module" will be located at `docusaurus/docs/vla-module/`.

2.  **Chapter as a File**: Each chapter within a module MUST be a Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`).
    -   Example: `docusaurus/docs/vla-module/cognitive-planning.md`.

3.  **File Naming**: Filenames SHOULD be URL-friendly (e.g., `kebab-case.md`) as they directly influence the final page URL.

4.  **Module Index**: Each module folder MAY contain an `index.md` or `_category_.json` file to define the landing page and sidebar properties for that module.

## Sidebar Configuration

- **Location**: `docusaurus/sidebars.js` (or similar configuration file).
- **Purpose**: Defines the navigation structure in the sidebar.

### Contract Rules:

1.  **Autogenerated Sidebar**: The primary contract is that the sidebar will be autogenerated from the `docusaurus/docs/` directory structure.
    -   Type: `autogenerated`
    -   `dirName`: `.` (relative to the `docs` folder)

This ensures that any module or chapter added to the `docs` directory will automatically appear in the navigation, enforcing discoverability. Any deviation from this file structure contract will result in a broken build or incorrect navigation.
