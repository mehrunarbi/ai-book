# Implementation Plan: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation with Docusaurus

**Branch**: `4-vla-module` (Note: This plan is for the entire repository's book generation process)
**Date**: 2025-12-10
**Spec**: `specs/4-vla-module/spec.md` (Note: The user's request is a meta-plan, not specific to this feature)

## Summary

This project establishes the complete workflow and technical foundation for creating the "AI-Native Robotics Book" using Docusaurus. The plan outlines a spec-driven architecture where content is generated based on formal specifications, processed, and built into a static Docusaurus website. Key deliverables include the Docusaurus site structure, a content creation and validation strategy, and a decision log for technical choices like theme, navigation, and versioning. The final outcome will be a cleanly built, consistent, and easily maintainable Docusaurus book, deployed via GitHub Pages, that adheres to the project's constitution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (MDX), Node.js (for Docusaurus v3)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus
**Storage**: N/A (Content sourced from Markdown files in the git repository)
**Testing**: `npm run build` (Docusaurus build success), manual content validation, broken link checker.
**Target Platform**: Web (via GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Web Application (Static Site Generator)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads (&lt;2s LCP), clean build in under 5 minutes.
**Constraints**: Must adhere to all rules in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Content must be organized logically.
**Scale/Scope**: 12-18 chapters across 4+ modules, plus a RAG chatbot integration.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Technical Accuracy**: The plan's workflow (Spec → Write) and validation steps support this principle. **PASS**
- **II. Clarity for Students**: Docusaurus is an excellent choice for presenting educational content clearly. The plan for a consistent structure supports this. **PASS**
- **III. Modular Architecture**: The proposed structure (Docusaurus project containing modules as content) is inherently modular. **PASS**
- **IV. Consistency**: The plan explicitly includes a quality validation step to enforce consistency in tone, terms, and formatting. **PASS**
- **V. Code Correctness**: The validation plan includes ensuring the Docusaurus build passes, which covers website-related code. **PASS**
- **VI. RAG Chatbot Integrity**: This plan focuses on the book structure. The RAG chatbot is a separate concern but the chosen Docusaurus platform is extensible and can accommodate a chatbot client. This principle is **Not in Scope** for this initial plan but is not violated.

All gates pass.

### Source Code (repository root)

A new `docusaurus/` directory will be created to house the entire book website. The markdown content from the `specs/` directories will be used as the source material for the pages in `docusaurus/docs/`.

```

**Structure Decision**: A new top-level `docusaurus/` directory will be created to encapsulate the entire website, keeping it separate from the specification and planning artifacts. The `docusaurus/docs` directory will contain the final, published book content, which will be generated from the source-of-truth markdown files in the various `specs/*/` directories.
