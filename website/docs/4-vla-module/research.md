# Research and Decision Log

This document records the key technical decisions made during the planning phase for the Docusaurus-based book creation project.

## 1. Docusaurus Theme

- **Decision**: Use the default `@docusaurus/theme-classic`.
- **Rationale**: The classic theme is the official, well-maintained, and feature-rich theme for Docusaurus. It provides an excellent and familiar baseline for a technical documentation site, including support for docs, a blog, and custom pages. Starting with the classic theme minimizes initial complexity and ensures long-term support.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Third-party themes**: Rejected to avoid external dependencies and potential maintenance issues.
  - **Building a custom theme**: Rejected as it would be a significant undertaking and is not necessary for the project's goals.

## 2. Content Versioning Strategy

- **Decision**: Utilize the built-in Docusaurus versioning system provided by `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs`.
- **Rationale**: The built-in system is the canonical and most robust method for handling versioning. It allows for snapshotting the entire `docs` directory at specific points in time (e.g., v1.0, v2.0). This is ideal for managing the book's releases as it evolves. Readers can easily switch between different published versions.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Git-based versioning**: Using different branches for different versions was considered but rejected. It is more complex to manage for a static site deployment and does not provide a user-friendly way for readers to switch between versions directly on the website.

## 3. Site Navigation and Sidebars

- **Decision**: Use an autogenerated sidebar based on the directory structure of the `docusaurus/docs/` folder. The structure will be `docs/<module-slug>/<chapter-slug>.md`.
- **Rationale**: Docusaurus can automatically create a sidebar from the file and folder hierarchy. This approach is the most simple and maintainable, as it requires no manual configuration when new chapters or modules are added. It guarantees that all content is discoverable.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Manual Sidebar (`sidebars.js`)**: Manually curating the sidebar file offers maximum control over the order and nesting of links. However, it was rejected for the initial phase because it adds significant maintenance overhead and is prone to human error (e.g., forgetting to add a new chapter). This can be revisited if the autogenerated sidebar becomes too limiting.
